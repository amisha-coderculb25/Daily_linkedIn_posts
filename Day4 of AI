Day 3 of “AI in Our Lives”
"AI is making us smarter. But is it also making us slower thinkers?"
That stayed with me. It bothered me.
Because… I think it's starting to become true.
Think about it 
We use AI to draft our emails.
We ask it to explain math before we even try.
We brainstorm with it before our brain even warms up.
Slowly, we’re outsourcing more than just effort.
We’re outsourcing the initial struggle, and that struggle is where real thinking, real creativity, and real growth happen.
If confusion is the gym for the brain,
then instant AI answers are skipping the workout completely.
The problem isn’t AI.
The problem is when we stop showing up with our own minds.
I’m not quitting AI, because you cannot.
But I’m choosing to stay awake while using it.
I want to collaborate with tech, not surrender to it.
Because if we’re not careful,
AI won’t make us better.
It’ll just make us… comfortable.
And comfort isn’t always growth.
So let’s use AI as a ladder, not a wheelchair.
One helps us rise. The other helps us sit.
“Don’t fast-forward your learnings.”
“Comfort is not intelligence.”
