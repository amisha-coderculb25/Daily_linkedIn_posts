I gave an interview to a bot… and it understood me better than some real interviewers.
There was no "Good morning." No smile. Just a screen and a blinking dot.
But somehow… it felt alive.
I recently gave an HR interview where the interviewer was… an "AI bot".
It listened. It followed up on my answers contextually. It paused.
It made me think harder than some human interviews have.
That day, I realized 
AI is not replacing humans. It’s reflecting us. Sharpening us.
As a fresher, it was intimidating at first. But also empowering.
It made me better at communicating clearly, because bots don’t "get" vague.
Interviews today aren’t just about skills. They’re about adaptability to people and programs.
And I’m okay with that. I’m preparing for it.
