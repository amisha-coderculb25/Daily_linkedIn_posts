Day 2 of "AI in Our Lives"
I recently gave a test where they allowed the use of AI. But that’s when it started testing me.
“You’re allowed to use AI tools during this test.”
Those words lit up my screen before I began my coding round.
I smiled for a second, thinking this would be easy.
I was wrong.
Because using AI isn’t the real challenge.
Knowing how to guide it, debug its answers, reframe the question, and still write clean, working code that’s the actual test.
And that’s when it hit me:
AI isn’t replacing developers. It’s replacing copy-pasters.
This wasn’t just about syntax.
It was about collaboration between the brain and the machine.
For every problem I solved with AI, I had to think harder, prompt better, and evaluate smarter.
At first, I felt like I was cheating, but then later I felt like I was in a team, me + AI, building something together.
And that’s what modern problem-solving looks like.
Not solo genius. But smart synergy.
And I learned that:
You’re not just being tested on answers. You’re being tested on how you think with tools.
